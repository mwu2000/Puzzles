# Puzzles
This is a package of puzzles that I made for my introductory computer science course. The user interface starts out with the game Kakurasu. You can navigate to Hitori or Skyscraper, the two other games. Visit the following sites for game rules:

Kakurasu, https://www.brainbashers.com/kakurasu.asp
Skyscraper, https://www.puzzlemix.com/Skyscraper
Hitori, https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/hitori/rules

The two .jpeg files are needed to run the game.

Happy playing!
